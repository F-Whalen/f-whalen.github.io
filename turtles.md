I have a friend wo is a wildlife biologist and a dog trainer. For fun, she trained her dogs to sniff out 
bos turtles on their ranch and indicated finds. She collected a lot of data on the turtles, 
including GPS coordinates of where they were found. She dosn't know GIS.

I am a student learning GIS. I am also a dog trainer. I needed data to practice on.  So I contacted
my friend to see if I could use her turtle data. 

It was a win-win! I got a fun data set to work with, and my friend got a nice project
she could use to visualize her data!
